            <h2>Chapter One: Why is she so cool?</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a girl named Crystal Ho. 
                Most people might know her as Computer Science major,
                but did you know she can go without blinking for 7 minutes straight? 
                Crystal Ho has a 9 minute and 30 second mile time.
                Crystal Ho won the 40 oz soda chugging contest at the Fairfax fair
                and finished it in under 20 seconds. She made history that day because she was the first woman to complete the challenge and threw up afterwards while no
                one was looking. Did you know Crystal's birthday is on February 19th? This is a problem as 
            some horoscope websites will say she is an Aries while some will say she 
        is a Pisces. This would usaully cause people to have an identity crisis, but Crystal Ho 
    does not care about horoscopes. That completes our chapter about why Crystal Ho is soooo super duper cool.</p>
